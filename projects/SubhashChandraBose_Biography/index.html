                    freedom fighters of India. He was a charismatic influencer of the youth and earned the epithet
                    ‘Netaji’ by establishing and leading the Indian National Army (INA) during India’s struggle for
                    independence. Although initially aligned with the Indian National Congress, he was ousted from the
                    party due to his difference in ideology. He sought assistance from Nazi leadership in Germany and
                    Imperial forces in Japan during the World War II, to overthrow the British
                    from India. His sudden disappearance post 1945, led to surfacing of various theories, concerning the
                    possibilities of his survival.

                    alt="Netaji">
                <figcaption class="figure-caption mb-4 mt-3">Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was born on 23 January, 1897 in
                    Cuttack (Orissa) to Janakinath Bose and
                    Prabhavati Devi. Subhash was the ninth child among eight brothers and six sisters. His father,
                    Janakinath Bose, was an affluent and successful lawyer in Cuttack and received the title of "Rai
                    Bahadur". He later became a member of the Bengal Legislative Council.

                    Subhash Chandra Bose was a brilliant student. He passed his B.A. in Philosophy from the Presidency
                    College in Calcutta. He was deeply influenced by Swami Vivekananda's teachings and was known for his
                    patriotic zeal as a student. In an incident where Bose beat up his professor (E.F. Otten) for his
                    racist
                    remarks, brought him notoriety as a rebel-Indian in eyes of the government. His father wanted Netaji
                    to
                    become a civil servant and therefore, sent him to England to appear for the Indian Civil Service
                    Examination. Bose was placed fourth with highest marks in English. But his urge for participating in
                    the
                    freedom movement was intense and in April 1921, he resigned from the coveted Indian Civil Service
                    and
                    came back to India. In December 1921, Bose was arrested and imprisoned for organizing a boycott of
                    the
                    celebrations to mark the Prince of Wales' visit to India.

                    During his stay in Berlin, he met and fell in love with Emily Schenkl, who was of Austrian origin.
                    Bose
                    and Emily were married in 1937 in a secret Hindu ceremony and Emily gave birth to a daughter Anita
                    in
                    1942. Shortly after the birth of their daughter, Bose left Germany in 1943 to come back to India.

            <h2 class="mt-2"><strong>Political Career</strong></h2>
            <h4 class="mt-4"><strong>Association with Indian National Congress</strong></h4>
            <p>Initially, Subhash Chandra Bose worked under the leadership of Chittaranjan Das, an active member of the
                Congress in Calcutta. It was Chittaranjan Das, who along with Motilal Nehru, left Congress and founded
                the Swaraj Party in 1922. Bose regarded Chittaranjan Das as his political guru. He himself started the
                newspaper ‘Swaraj’, edited Das’ newspaper ‘Forward’ and worked as the CEO of Calcutta Municipal
                Corporation under Das’ stint as Mayor. Subhash Chandra Bose played an important role in enlightening the
                students, youths and labourers of Calcutta. In his fervent wait to see India as an independent, federal
                and republic nation, he emerged as a charismatic and firebrand youth icon. He was admired within the
                congress for his great ability in organization development. He served several stints in prison for his
                nationalist activities during this time.
            </p>
            <h4 class="mt-2"><strong>Dispute with the Congress</strong></h4>
            <p>In 1928, during the Guwahati Session of the Congress, a difference of opinion surfaced between the old
                and new members of the Congress. The young leaders wanted a "complete self-rule and without any
                compromise’ while the senior leaders were in favour of the "dominion status for India within the British
                rule".
            </p>
            <p>The differences between moderate Gandhi and aggressive Subhash Chandra Bose swelled to irreconcilable
                proportions and Bose decided to resign from the party in 1939. He went on to form the Forward Bloc the
                same year.
            </p>
            <p>Although he voiced his dislike for the British often in his correspondences, he also expressed his
                admiration for their structured way of life. He met with the leaders of the British Labor Party and
                political thinkers including Clement Attlee, Harold Laski, J.B.S. Haldane, Arthur Greenwood, G.D.H.
                Cole, and Sir Stafford Cripps and discussed the possibilities that an independent India might hold.

                    Bose vehemently opposed the Congress decision to support the British during the Second World War.
                    With
                    the aim to initiate a mass movement, Bose called out to Indians for their whole-hearted
                    participation.
                    There was tremendous response to his call “Give me blood and I will give you freedom” and the
                    British
                    promptly imprisoned him. In jail, he declared a hunger-srtike. When his health deteriorated, the
                    authorities, fearing violent reactions, released him but put him under house-arrest.

                    In January, 1941, Subhash made a planned escape and reached Berlin, Germany via a detour through
                    Peshawar. Germans assured him their full support in his endeavours and he gained allegiance of Japan
                    as
                    well. He took a perilous journey back east and reached Japan where he assumed command over 40,000
                    soldiers recruited from Singapore and other south East Asian regions. He called his army the ‘Indian
                    National Army’ (INA) and led the same to capture the Andaman and Nicobar islands from the British
                    and
                    rechristened it as Shaheed and Swaraj Islands. A provisional “Azad Hind Government” started
                    functioning
                    in the captured territories. The INA or the Azad Hind Fauj stared for India and crossed Burma
                    Border,
                    and stood on Indian soil on March 18, 1944. Unfortunately, the tide of the World War turned and the
                    Japanese and German forces surrendered which forced him to call off further advancement.

            <h2 class="mt-4"><strong>Death</strong></h2>
            <p>Netaji disappeared mysteriously soon after the retreat. It is said that he went back to Singapore and met
                Field Marshal Hisaichi Terauchi, head of all military operations in South East Asia who arranged for him
                a flight to Tokyo. He boarded a Mitsubishi Ki-21 heavy bomber from Saigon Airport on August 17, 1945.
                The following day the bomber crashed shortly after take-off after a night halt in Taiwan. Witnesses
                report that Bose sustained intense third degree burns in the process. He succumbed to his injuries on
                Aug 18, 1945. He was cremated on August 20 in Taihoku Crematorium and his ashes were laid to rest at the
                Renk?ji Temple of Nichiren Buddhism in Tokyo.

                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Bose’s comrades who were stranded in Saigon waiting to be transported
                    never saw his body. Nor did they
                    see any photographs of his injuries. They refused to believe that their hero was dead and hoped that
                    he
                    evaded detection by the British-American forces. They believed whole heartedly that it was just a
                    matter
                    of time that Netaji will gather up his army and conduct a march towards Delhi. Soon people began to
                    report sighting of the hero and even Gandhi expressed his scepticism about death of Bose.
                    Post-independence, people started to believe that Netaji had adopted an acetic life and became a
                    Sadhu.
                    The mysteries surrounding Bose’s death took upon mythic proportions and perhaps symbolized the hope
                    of
                    the nation.
                    <p>The government of India set up a number of committees to investigate the case. First the Figgess
                        Report
                        in 1946 and then the Shah Nawaz Committee in 1956, concluded that Bose had indeed died in the
                        crash in
                        Taiwan.
                    </p>

                    <p>Later, the Khosla Commission (1970) concurred with the earlier reports, the reports of Justice
                        Mukherjee
                        Commission (2006) said, "Bose did not die in the plane crash and the ashes at Renkoji temple are
                        not
                        his". However, the findings were rejected by the Government of India.
                    </p>

                    <p>In 2016, following the declassification of a report handed over by the Japanese government to the
                        Indian
                        Embassy in Tokyo in 1956, titled "Investigation on the cause of death and other matters of the
                        late
                        Subhash Chandra Bose" confirmed the Indian National Hero’s death in Taiwan on August 18, 1945.

            <h3 class="mt-5"><strong>Legacy</strong></h3>
            <p>Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose has left deep impact on the psyche of his countrymen. His slogan, ‘Jai Hind’
                is still used in reverence to the country. The International airport in Kolkata has been named Netaji
                Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport to commemorate the charismatic leader.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-5"><strong>In Popular Media</strong></h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Many documentaries, TV series and films have been made on the life of netaji. In 2004,
                revered director
                Shyam Benegal made a biopic ‘Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose: The Forgotten Hero’ that received immense
                critical acclaim in India as well as in international film festivals.
