# Pig game

Pig is a simple two player dice game.


Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice. The player may decide to hold the score and change turn or addup with another roll.

- If the player rolls a 1, their current score gets zeroed and the other player takes turn.
- If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their current score and the player's turn continues.
- If a player chooses to "hold" the current score, their turn total is added to their score and the other player takes turn.
- The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
