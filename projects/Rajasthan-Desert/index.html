      <!-- Actual content added under Thar by removing dummy data -->
      <p>
        Thar is a desert region located in northwestern India and southeastern
        Pakistan. It is part of the larger Great Indian Desert, which stretches
        across an area of approximately 200,000 square kilometers (77,000 square
        miles). The Thar Desert is known for its arid and inhospitable
        conditions, characterized by vast stretches of sand dunes, rocky
        terrain, and a scarcity of water.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has a rich cultural heritage, with several indigenous communities
        residing in the region, such as the Rajputs, Jats, Bishnois, and Bhils.
        These communities have adapted their lifestyles to the desert conditions
        and have unique traditions, arts, crafts, and cuisine that reflect their
        desert culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tourism in the Thar Desert has gained popularity over the years,
        attracting visitors who are interested in experiencing the desert
        landscape, camel safaris, desert camping, and exploring the traditional
        villages and heritage sites in the region. Cities like Jaisalmer and
        Jodhpur in Rajasthan, India, serve as popular gateways to the Thar
        Desert and offer a glimpse into the desert way of life.
